bio: |
  Robotics and human-robot interaction researcher advancing human-centered
  robot learning through deep reinforcement learning, preference learning,
  and adaptive interactive systems. My work spans from foundational RL theory
  to real-world deployment, including a museum installation with 60,000+
  public visitors.
